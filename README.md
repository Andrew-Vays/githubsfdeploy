# GitHub Salesforce Deploy Tool

Read more about this tool at my blog post [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/09/24/deploy-direct-from-github-to-salesforce/). 

**Update: 21 May 2015:** Added support for private GitHub repositories. When deploying a private repository the user is redirected to GitHub authorization window. After authorizing, a private repository can be deployed exactly the same way as a public one. Contributed by [Moti Korets](https://github.com/motiko).   

**Update: 27th September 2014:** Added feature to generate Deploy to Salesforce button, thanks to [Karanraj](https://twitter.com/karanrajs) for the image.
